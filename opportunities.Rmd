**Needed: candidates with skills in data analysis and / or statistical programming**   
  
An increasing number of our current and future projects involve analysing large, multistructure *Big Data* outputs to prepare them for spatial and spatio-temporal analysis. Candidates with interests in applying these skills to spatial epidemiology or other aspects of [One Health](https://www.who.int/features/qa/one-health/en/){target="_blank"} should contact [Associate Professor Ricardo Soares Magalh√£es](people.html){target="_blank"} or [Dr Nicholas Clark](people.html#nicholas_clark){target="_blank"} to discuss opportunities.
