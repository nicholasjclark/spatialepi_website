Members of our team a wealth of expertise owing to their diverse backgrounds in veterinary science, ecology, spatial epidemiology and mathematical modelling. We apply spatial epidemiology and risk mapping approaches for projects at interface between animal and human public health to develop a broader understanding of what mechanisms influence the geographical distributions of animal and human infections.

<center>Prof Magalhães is an infectious disease epidemiologist with qualifications in both human and veterinary public health. His primary research focus is on the application of spatial risk assessment methods and population-based intervention studies to provide epidemiological evidence for more rational implementation of strategies for the control of infectious diseases of animals and humans. His interests are broad, ranging from the development of geographical models of infectious disease distribution to quantifying the role of spatial variation as an influence on socio-economic indicators such as water, sanitation and hygiene, to assessing the spatial distributions of helminth infection of children and associated morbidities. He has fostered collaborations that encompass many international and domestic partners, with a diversity of ongoing projects supported locally at UQ's [Child Health Research Centre](https://child-health-research.centre.uq.edu.au/){target="_blank"}, [School of Veterinary Science](https://veterinary-science.uq.edu.au/){target="_blank"} and [School of Public Health](https://public-health.uq.edu.au/){target="_blank"}. He is currently seeking PhD candidates with skills in data analysis, statistical programming and machine learning to contribute to projects linking Big Data to spatial and spatio-temporal epidemiology.

<center>Tuhin started his research career as a research fellow in one of the centre of excellence "Centre for Control of Chronic Diseases" at icddr,b which was established with funding support from [National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI)](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/){target="_blank"}. He has experience working in a number of research projects that include diabetes & prediabetes, surveillance and community management of hypertension, metabolic syndrome, child obesity, mental health and its resultant health effects in Bangladesh. His major works included implementation of research projects; planning, organizing and carry out various research/field research and study activities. His PhD research will explore the double burden of malnutrition among the women in South and Southeast Asia and its geographical variation, health inequality and health achievement. Tuhin’s advisors are [A/Prof Abdullah Mamun](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/1318){target="_blank"} and [A/Prof Ricardo Soares Magalhães](#ricardo).

<center>Xiaoyan is currently a PhD student studying the spatial epidemiology of emerging infectious diseases. Xiaoyan’s research topic is Spatial Risk Assessment of the Zoonotic Influenza A (H7N9) along the Live Meat Chicken Market Chain in Southeast China. Her research aims to get a better understanding of live poultry market chains in eastern China, with the specific aim to define the risks of sustained transmission of H7N9 virus along the live meat chicken market chain in eastern China. Before she started her PhD, she has been working as national GIS specialist for the [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in China](http://www.fao.org/china/en/){target="_blank"} for over four years. Here she mainly focused on applying statistical modeling and simulation approaches to conduct risk assessment and spatial prediction to better understand the epidemiological features of zoonotic  diseases in Asian countries. Xiaoyan obtained her master’s degree in Geospatial Sciences and Remote Sensing from the [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.cas.cn/){target="_blank"}.</center>

### Alex Pekin 
<img src="images/alex_profile.jpg" class="round" style="border:4px solid; margin-bottom: 20px" alt="Alex Pekin  is an Honours student at the Spatial Epidemiology Group, University of Queensland"/>

<center>Alex was an Honours scholar at the University of Queensland. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science (Animal and Veterinary Bioscience) in 2018 and is researching risk factors and spatial distribution of dog bite attacks in South-East Queensland; a collaborative project between the University of Queensland and Queensland Health. He is committed to utilizing a One Health approach as a method of improving healthcare infrastructure in developed and developing countries. As an undergraduate he contributed to work quantifying the temporal relationship between H7N9 avian influenza onset in humans with poultry surveillance, live bird movements, and sociodemographic factors. He plans to pursue further study into One Health issues, with a focus on veterinary solutions and interventions. Alex’s advisor was [A/Prof Ricardo Soares Magalhães](#ricardo).</center>

<!-- <center>Dr Cortes-Ramirez is a medical doctor with clinical experience in diagnosis and treatment of tropical diseases including vector-borne diseases and zoonoses. He worked as a medical practitioner for 10 years in Colombia and Chile, as medical doctor with the International Committee of the Red Cross (2002) and as a consultant for [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/){target="_blank"} for a national project on Environmental Health in the Solomon Islands (2015). As a researcher, he has experience studying the prevalence of ofidism (snake bite), Chagas disease in tropical countries as well as risk factors associated with silicosis in miners in Chile. In the last four years, he has developed spatial epidemiological studies on the association of coal mining with hospitalisations in Queensland. Dr Cortes-Ramirez is currently a lecturer in Environmental Health at UQ's [School of Public Health](https://public-health.uq.edu.au/){target="_blank"} Read more about his work at his [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Javier_Cortes-Ramirez) page.</center> -->
