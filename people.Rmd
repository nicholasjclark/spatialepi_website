Members of our team a wealth of expertise owing to their diverse backgrounds in veterinary science, ecology, spatial epidemiology and mathematical modellings. We apply spatial epidemiology and risk mapping approaches for projects at interface between animal and human public health to develop a broader understanding of what mechanisms influence the geographical distributions of animal and human infections.

### Nicholas Clark
<img src="images/nick_profile.JPG" class="round" style="border:4px solid; margin-bottom: 20px" alt="Dr Nicholas J Clark is a postdoctoral fellow at the Spatial Epidemiology Group, University of Queensland"/>

<center>Dr Clark is a Postdoctoral Fellow with broad interests in spatial epidemiology, molecular ecology and identifying mechanisms that influence the spread of disease at the human-wildlife interface. He graduated with a PhD from [Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au/environmental-futures-research-institute){target="_blank"} under primary supervision of [Dr Sonya Clegg](https://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-sonya-clegg){target="_blank"}, where he used mathematical models to study avian malaria parasites. His role with the group is to conduct spatial modelling of zoonotic pathogens, primarily Q fever and rabies, as well as to lead efforts to forecast risks of tick infestation for Australian domestic animals.

<img src="images/pandji_profile.jpg" class="round" style="border:4px solid; margin-bottom: 20px" alt="Dr Pandji Dhewantara is a PhD student at the Spatial Epidemiology Group, University of Queensland"/>

<center>Pandji is an early-career researcher working at the [National Institute of Health Research and Development (NIHRD)-Ministry of Health of Indonesia](https://www.litbang.kemkes.go.id/){target="_blank"}. He obtained his Master's degree on Environmental science in Padjajaran University, Bandung, Indonesia. In Indonesia, his research particularly focuses on the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases such as dengue, malaria and lymphatic filariasis. Currently, his PhD project is focusing on leptospirosis – a zoonotic bacterial disease caused by Leptospira in China. His project is aiming at estimating the burden of human leptospirosis in China and using spatial analytical tools to understand the spatial epidemiology of human leptospirosis in China and the effects of demographical, ecological and socio-economic factors on the geographical and temporal pattern of human leptospirosis. Pandji’s advisors are [A/Prof Ricardo Soares Magalhães](#ricardo), [A/Prof. Abdullah Mamun](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/1318){target="_blank"} from UQ's Institute of Social Science Research and [Prof. Wenbiao Hu](https://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/w2.hu){target="_blank"} from the School of Public Health and Social Work, Queensland University of Technology.
