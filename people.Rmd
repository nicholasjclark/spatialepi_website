Members of our team a wealth of expertise owing to their diverse backgrounds in veterinary science, ecology, spatial epidemiology and mathematical modelling. We apply spatial epidemiology and risk mapping approaches for projects at interface between animal and human public health to develop a broader understanding of what mechanisms influence the geographical distributions of animal and human infections.

<img src="images/ricardo_profile.jpeg" class="round" style="border:4px solid; margin-bottom: 20px" alt="Ricardo Soares Magalhães is head of the Spatial Epidemiology Group, University of Queensland"/>

<center>A/Prof Magalhães is an infectious disease epidemiologist with qualifications in both human and veterinary public health. His primary research focus is on the application of spatial risk assessment methods and population-based intervention studies to provide epidemiological evidence for more rational implementation of strategies for the control of infectious diseases of animals and humans. His interests are broad, ranging from the development of geographical models of infectious disease distribution to quantifying the role of spatial variation as an influence on socio-economic indicators such as water, sanitation and hygiene, to assessing the spatial distributions of helminth infection of children and associated morbidities. He has fostered collaborations that encompass many international and domestic partners, with a diversity of ongoing projects supported locally at UQ's [Child Health Research Centre](https://child-health-research.centre.uq.edu.au/){target="_blank"}, [School of Veterinary Science](https://veterinary-science.uq.edu.au/){target="_blank"} and [School of Public Health](https://public-health.uq.edu.au/){target="_blank"}. He is currently seeking PhD candidates with skills in data analysis, statistical programming and machine learning to contribute to projects linking Big Data to spatial and spatio-temporal epidemiology.
