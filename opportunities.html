<h2>PhD opportunities</h2>
<p><strong>PhD scholarship in targeted surveillance of major zoonotic arboviral and other vector-borne diseases in Australia using spectroscopy technology</strong><br />
Infectious diseases transmitted by vectors represent a significant health threat to the Australian biosecurity. Detection methods used in current surveillance of these pathogens are expensive, time consuming and require highly trained personnel. The PhD project: We propose to conduct a set of experiments to test the best spectroscopy technique to identify infected vectors and demonstrate its capacity as surveillance tool for vector control programs against these pathogens. The candidate will be based at The University of Queensland within the School of Veterinary Science, Gatton Campus, and will be supervised by <a href="https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/22990">Dr. Silvia Ciocchetta</a>, <a href="https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/16992">Dr. Maggy Lord</a>, <a href="https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/171">Prof. Malcolm Jones</a>, and <a href="people.html" target="_blank">Associate Professor Ricardo Soares Magalhães</a>.</p>
<p>This <strong>PhD scholarship</strong> is funded by the Australian Government, providing a tax-free PhD stipend of $28,597 per annum tax free (2021 rate), indexed annually, and full tuition fee support. The scholarship is for three years, with two possible six-month extensions. Applications will be judged on a competitive basis considering the applicant’s previous academic record, publication record, honours and awards, and employment history.</p>
<p><em>Competitive applicants should have</em><br />
* A BSc with First Class Honours or Masters degree with distinction, majoring in a relevant discipline (parasitology or molecular biology including cell culture and PCR or molecular epidemiology or ecology).<br />
* Research experience combining laboratory and epidemiological/disease or species ecology skills.<br />
* Academic achievement in the field(s) of life science, biology, entomology, infectious disease epidemiology, species ecology and the potential for scholastic success.<br />
* A working knowledge of molecular biology techniques including DNA/RNA extractions and qualitative and quantitative PCRs, microbiology techniques, handling biosecurity samples and geographical information systems would be of benefit to someone working on this project.<br />
* Excellent time and data management and interpersonal skills.<br />
* Demonstrated evidence of good oral and written communication skills.</p>
<p><em>Desirable characteristics</em><br />
* Publication record in international peer-reviewed journals.<br />
* A background or knowledge of biology, entomology, medical entomology, and geospatial modelling is highly desirable.<br />
* Knowledge of script-based statistical languages such as R or Python.</p>

<strong>PhD scholarship in multivariate ecological forecasting</strong></p>
<p>The Spatial Epidemiology Laboratory at the University of Queensland seeks a PhD student to work on an exciting new project: forecasting ecosystem responses to environmental change</p>
<p>There is a growing consensus that using models to anticipate the future is vital to mitigate the impacts of environmental change on ecosystems. Yet most ecological models are one-off attempts to predict what ecosystems might be like in many years or decades. This makes it hard for decision-makers to use these models. It also favours models that are not easily scrutinised and improved. A new international study will use an iterative cycle to 1) forecast how species occurrences and abundances will change over short timescales; 2) use predictions to inspect model failures and 3) improve models so that we can continue to learn. This represents a new way of thinking in ecology that, like weather forecasting, has the power to advance our understanding of ecological processes.</p>
<p>The candidate will work within a vibrant team to tackle two major questions in ecological modelling:<br />
(1) When can multivariate models improve forecasts of species distributions, abundances and biodiversity compared to simpler models?<br />
(2) What aspects of models and data control forecast uncertainty across space and time?</p>
<p>Applications will be judged on a competitive basis taking into account the applicant’s previous academic record, publication record, honours and awards, and employment history. Skills in quantitative analysis, ecological modelling, forecasting or statistical programming are highly desired. To verify whether you meet the Academic Entry Requirements refer to: <a href="https://future-students.uq.edu.au/study/programs/doctor-philosophy-7501#overview" class="uri">https://future-students.uq.edu.au/study/programs/doctor-philosophy-7501#overview</a>.</p>

The candidate will also work with a diverse group of international researchers. Support will be given by partners at the <a href="https://ecoforecast.org/">Ecological Forecasting Initiative</a> and the Spatial Epidemiology Laboratory, including assistance in data analysis, model building and communication.</p>
<p>This <strong>PhD scholarship</strong> is funded by the Australian Government, providing a tax-free PhD stipend of $28,597 per annum tax free (2021 rate). The scholarship is for three years, with two possible six-month extensions. Funds are also available for the student to attend scientific conferences and workshops.</p>
